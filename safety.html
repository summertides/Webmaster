            Prior to you learning how to stay safe in space, a Captain will teach the procedures of everything on the ship!

            Our Ships have been approved and built by over 100 major nations. Once built, they have been tested by different space organizations such as Nasa, SpaceX, and Sierra Nevada Corporation.

            Every ship has a Medbay to provide services to the passengers. The Medbay consists of a team of doctors and nurses trained to provide hospitality. The equipment is premium graded in the Medbay.

            In order to get ready for space, you must go through our training protocol which consists of a mockup vehicle that will show all procedures for safety. This protocol will occur before you are able to depart from our station. The Captain of your ship will inform you of the safety pods' locations and operation of them; in case of an accident.

            Another step of the safety procedure will be learning how to operate your own spacesuit. Learning this part is very crucial as it is pretty challenging to learn the controls within a spacesuit.

            Passengers will take a Gravity test to get the grips of the gravity within the ship.
